At Amazon, we look to our leadership principles every day to guide our decision-making. Our approach to AI development naturally follows from our leadership principle “Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility.” As we continue to scale the capabilities of Amazon’s frontier models and democratize access to the benefits of AI, we also take responsibility for mitigating the risks of our technology. Consistent with Amazon’s endorsement of the Korea Frontier AI Safety Commitments, this Framework outlines the protocols we will follow to ensure that frontier models developed by Amazon do not expose critical capabilities that have the potential to create severe risks. At its core, this Framework reflects our commitment that we will not deploy frontier AI models developed by Amazon that exceed specified risk thresholds without appropriate safeguards in place.
This Framework focuses on severe risks that are unique to frontier AI models as they scale in size and capability and which require specialized evaluation methods and safeguards. Our approach to managing these frontier risks complements Amazon's broader approach to responsible AI, which includes comprehensive practices to control for risks across eight key dimensions.
