Extract ALL risk thresholds and capability tiers from this AI safety framework document.

For each organization mentioned, extract:
1. Organization name
2. Framework name (e.g., "Responsible Scaling Policy", "Frontier Safety Framework")
3. Risk tiers/levels (e.g., ASL-1, ASL-2, ASL-3, CCL-1, CCL-2, etc.)

For each risk tier, extract:
4. Capability threshold definition (what makes a model reach this tier?)
5. Compute threshold in FLOPS (if mentioned, otherwise null)
6. Evaluation requirements (what tests must be run?)
7. Required safeguards (what security/safety measures?)
8. Deployment restrictions (if any)

Return as JSON with this structure:
{
  "frameworks": [
    {
      "organization": "string",
      "framework_name": "string",
      "version": "string",

          "capability_threshold": "string",
          "compute_threshold_flops": number or null,
