Extract all compute-related thresholds from this document.

Extract:
1. Specific FLOP thresholds mentioned (e.g., 10^25, 10^26)
2. What each threshold triggers (regulations, evaluations, etc.)
3. How algorithmic efficiency affects thresholds
4. Verification mechanisms for compute claims

Return as JSON:
