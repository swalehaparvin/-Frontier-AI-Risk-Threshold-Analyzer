# Project Overview

This is a new, empty Python project. The repository contains only a blank `main.py` file, indicating this is a fresh starting point for development.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Current State

The project is in its initial state with no established architecture yet. As the project develops, this section should be updated to reflect:

- **Application Type**: To be determined (web app, CLI tool, API service, etc.)
- **Design Patterns**: To be established based on project requirements
- **Code Organization**: Currently a single entry point (`main.py`)

### Development Approach

Since this is a blank slate:
1. Start by implementing features directly in `main.py` for simple scripts
2. As complexity grows, consider organizing code into modules/packages
3. Follow Python best practices (PEP 8 style guide, type hints where helpful)

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies

None currently configured.

### Adding Dependencies

When dependencies are needed:
1. Use a `requirements.txt` file or `pyproject.toml` for dependency management
2. Document major dependencies and their purposes in this section
3. Consider using virtual environments for isolation

### Potential Integrations

As the project evolves, document any:
- Database connections (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- External APIs
- Third-party services
- Authentication providers
